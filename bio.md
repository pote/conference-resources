Pablo Astigarraga (better known as PoTe) comes from a Python background writing Asterisk-based VoIP systems, has several years of experience doing Rails/Ruby, contributing to open source projects and currently works for an amazingly fun startup called Vivid Cortex.

Passionate about minimalistic software, Unix philosophy, doing things right, having fun with cool people and using spaces instead of tabs, pote copes with a somewhat unhealthy relationship with mustaches and is always willing to discuss the evils of premature optimization over a beer.
