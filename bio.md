pote comes from a Python background writing Asterisk-based VoIP systems, has several years of experience doing Rails/Ruby and has moved on to doing work with Go, Lua or other alternatives when the problem at hands permits it, he loves contributing to open source projects, he is one of the authors of the @surculusfructum podcast as well as a member of the [13Floor.org](http://13floor.org) software collective.

Passionate about minimalistic software, Unix philosophy, doing things right, having fun with cool people and using spaces instead of tabs, pote has a hard time talking about himself in the third person but is always willing to discuss the evils of premature optimisation over a beer.
