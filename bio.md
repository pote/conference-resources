pote comes from a Python background writing Asterisk-based VoIP systems, has several years of experience doing Rails/Ruby and has been known to work with Go, Lua or other alternatives when the job permits it, he loves contributing to open source projects, blogging about tech and is one of the authors of the @surculusfructum podcast.

Passionate about minimalistic software, Unix philosophy, doing things right, having fun with cool people and using spaces instead of tabs, pote copes with a somewhat unhealthy relationship with moustaches and is always willing to discuss the evils of premature optimisation over a beer.
